# ubuntu-vps-wireguard-server-installer
This bash script will let you do a one click install of Wireguard on any Ubuntu VPS so you can have your own "VPN Server". 
This file was forked from https://github.com/angristan/wireguard-install if you want the original -- they did a AWESOME JOB!
But I wanted some customizations which I will explain.
